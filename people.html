Dr. Mohsen Asadnia is a senior lecturer in the Engineering Department, Macquarie University. He received his PhD in Mechanical Engineering from Nanyang Technological University (NTU)-Singapore, and undertook his postdoctoral trainings at Singapore MIT Alliance for research and Technology (SMART) and the University of Western Australia (UWA). His PhD research was focused on development of bio-inspired sensory systems using MEMS techniques. At MIT, he expanded his research interest towards developing artificial inner ear haircell sensors. Dr. Asadnia is currently working on development of novel transistor-based sensor technology for fast, reliable and accurate in situ monitoring of recycled wastewater. In addition, he is also collaborating with multi-disciplinary groups at Nanyang Technological University (NTU) and SMART for development of ultra-sensitive MEMS flow sensors for using in intravenous injections.                </p>

                    Dr Hamid Alinejad Rokny is a UNSW Scientia Fellow at the UNSW Graduate School of Biomedical Engineering. 
                    He received his master degree in artificial intelligence/machine learning and his Ph.D in computational biology from UNSW Australia, 2018. 
                    Before finishing his Ph.D, Dr Rokny joined to Prof Alistair Forrest Lab at Harry Perkins Institute of Medical Research in Western Australia as a postdoc. 
                    His Ph.D and postdoctoral research focuses in using advanced data analytics and cutting-edge machine learning techniques in identifying disease-specific 
                    genomic variants, identifying disease-candidate protein-coding and non-coding genes, and 
                    identifying gene regulation factors in genetic diseases and disorders, are all important 
                    and state-of-the-art research topics, with a great impact on the bio-data science era and health of societies, worldwide. Dr. Rokny is currently leading 
                    multiple international projects (jointly with UWA, Uni Adelaide, SUT, and Texas Biomed) investigating the impacts of non-coding regulatory variants in genetic 
                    diseases (e.g. neurodevelopmental disorders, breast cancer) through integration of Hi-C, ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, and genomic variants. He is keen to see accurate 
                    diagnostic genomic tools implemented into the clinic to improve the health care and genomic-based treatments in the Australian health system. Dr Rokny has 
                    been invited to serve as Keynote Speaker, program committee member of top international conferences.                </p>

                    Frank holds a Master of Research in data science from Macquarie University.
                    Frank's vision is to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the policing domain using technology as the enabler. 
                    His research endeavours have been centred around improving the police officer's effectiveness and efficiency in crime response, detection, 
                    prevention and disruption through the use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT).
                    In doing so he draws from 30 years of knowledge and experience in the policing domain as a police officer with the New South Wales Police Force and 
                    Superintendent at the Australian Federal Police. Frank began his career in 1988 with the New South Wales Police Force. He's appointments to positions 
                    have enabled him to develop skills and competencies; in policing, criminal investigation (awarded the designation of Detective), fraud, cybercrime, 
                    computer forensics, information and communications technology, and open innovation.
                    Frank has developed a mobile application framework called ICOPS (Interactive Constable on Patrol System) that will deliver digital transformation to the police officers and 
                    interact with future smart/safe city initiatives.
                    Frank is a certified professional - MACS (Snr) CP with the Australia Computer Society.
